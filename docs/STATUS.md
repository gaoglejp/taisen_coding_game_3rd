# Status

Rolling cross-agent status report shared between Claude Code and Codex.
Updated on every push. See `AGENTS.md` for the workflow expectations.

When you push, do these three things in `docs/STATUS.md`:

## Latest

- **PR**: #TBD — feat(admin): room overview activity feed real-data
- **Branch**: `codex/v0.2-room-activity`
- **Date**: 2026-05-25
- **Status**: open, awaiting CI

### What changed

- Added `GET /api/admin/rooms/:id/activity` with `isAdmin` + own-room guard for `ROOM_ADMIN`, room existence check, `limit` (default 12 / max 50), AuditLog query, and actor display-name resolution.
- Wired `src/app/admin/rooms/[roomId]/page.tsx` activity panel to real API data and removed `MOCK_ACTIVITIES`.
- Activity UI now formats time from `createdAt` (`HH:MM` for today, `M/D` otherwise), expands action icon mapping for audit actions, and shows an empty state when no events exist.

### Parallel work (Claude)

- Claude branch remains focused on route-handler test expansion and docs updates; no overlap with `server.ts` or member/user route bodies.

### Next 1–3 PRs (recommended order)

1. Add route-handler tests for `/api/admin/rooms/:id/activity` (401/403/404/room-admin own-room/limit clamp).
2. Optionally add pure-function vitest for activity time formatting + icon mapping.
3. Continue remaining Milestone C/A gaps (`room schedule` source decision and coding `lastTurn` source).

### Deferred / out of scope right now

- `RoomActivity` model producers remain unused; activity is intentionally unified on `AuditLog`.
- Match start/end timeline-style events are not fabricated when absent in audit logs.

### Open questions / handoff notes

- Browser behavior is not validated in this container; manual verification required on local dev server.

## History

- **PR #34** (merged) — feat(watch): spectator real-data (viewer count + timeline).

- **PR #32** (open) — test(admin): matches POST + users PATCH route tests; suite to 53; lint/type/build clean.
- **PR #30** (merged) — test(admin): first route-handler tests (match-cancel
  7, standings 3) + a Vitest `@`→`src` alias so routes can be imported. 37 tests.
- **PR #29** (merged) — feat(admin): wired `TournamentView` as a round-grouped
  real-match list (per `Match.round` columns of `BracketMatch` cards); a true
  bracket tree still needs match-advancement schema linkage.
- **PR #27** (merged) — chore(watch): removed the dev-only state-variations
  gallery (+ its 5 helpers, ~341 lines) from the watch page. Viewer
  count / commentary left as placeholders pending real sources.
- **PR #26** (merged) — feat(admin): wired `RoundRobinView` (head-to-head
  matrix + W/L/D summary) to real match data; `TournamentView` left on mock
  pending bracket-linkage schema.
- **PR #25** (merged) — feat(admin): wired the matches-page create-match
  modal to a real member picker + per-mode `POST …/matches` (roster fetch,
  search/add/remove chips, preview counts); dropped the unbacked 備考 field.
- **PR #24** (merged) — feat(admin): enriched `/api/admin/rooms/:id/standings`
  (per-player avg dmg dealt/taken, avg turns, recent form, recentMatches +
  room meta + summary/end-reason counts) and wired the room standings page
  (table, drawer, KPIs, donut, period filter); dropped fabricated deltas.
- **PR #23** (merged) — feat(coding): real Blockly (v12) strategy editor +
  `strategy-blocks.ts` workspace→`Strategy` serializer; coding page submits
  the live strategy instead of a stub. Milestone A blocker cleared.
- **PR #22** (merged) — feat(admin): match-cancel endpoint
  (`POST /api/admin/rooms/:id/matches/:matchId/cancel`) + wired the
  matches-page cancel modal. Closed out the admin write-action surface.
- **PR #21** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system rooms + users page write
  actions. Rooms: create / soft-delete / archive↔restore. Users:
  invite / disable / force-password-reset, with invite & reset links
  surfaced one-time via a new `LinkResult` copy helper (no email infra).
- **PR #20** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room member write actions
  (issue / reissue / disable) on
  `src/app/admin/rooms/[roomId]/members/page.tsx`. First real admin
  mutations; removed `MOCK_ISSUED_CODES`; works for ROOM_ADMIN +
  SYSTEM_ADMIN.
- **PR #19** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room settings page to
  `/api/admin/rooms/:id` (GET/PATCH + archive/restore/delete),
  SYSTEM_ADMIN-only per product decision. rulePreset round-trips but is
  simulator-inert.
- **PR #18** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room matches page (LIST) to
  `/api/admin/rooms/:id/matches`. Bracket views + create/cancel modals
  still mock; matches endpoint extended to return `room`.
- **PR #17** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room members page to
  `/api/admin/rooms/:id/members` (+ standings for W/L/D). Members
  endpoint extended to return `room`.
- **PR #16** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system audit page (cursor
  pagination; category/type filtered client-side) + room overview page
  (`/api/admin/rooms/:id` + matches/standings; activity still mock).
- **PR #15** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system rooms page to
  `/api/admin/rooms` (server-side filter + pagination + global status
  count pills). ROADMAP Milestone D rooms-page row done.
- **PR #14** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system users page to
  `/api/admin/users` (server-side filter + pagination). ROADMAP
  Milestone D users-page row done.
- **PR #13** (merged) — test(auth): 15 unit tests for `src/lib/auth.ts`
  (token round-trip, role guards, `getSession` branches with mocked
  cookies + Prisma). Suite total 24. ROADMAP Milestone E auth row done.
- **PR #12** (merged) — feat(rooms): wire matches list + standings +
  your-record to `/api/rooms/:n/{matches,standings}`. ROADMAP Milestone
  C mostly done (schedule + announcements remain).
- **PR #11** (merged) — feat(rooms): wire rooms page hero to
  `/api/rooms/:roomNumber` + add `docs/ROADMAP.md` (v0.2 definition of
  done + milestones A–E).
- **PR #10** (merged) — chore(test): Vitest + 9 simulator unit tests +
  wired into CI. HANDOFF section 4 item 5 closed.
- **PR #9** (merged) — feat(watch): wire watch page to
  `/api/match/:id/public` + live `turn_event`. Drops `META` constant;
  tank positions / HP / actions / cumulative damage all live.
- **PR #8** (merged) — feat(coding): wire coding page header to
  `/api/match/:id/state`. Drops `MOCK_MATCH` from the coding page;
  `/state` endpoint extended to include `room`.
- **PR #7** (merged) — feat(result): wire result page to
  `/api/match/:id/result` + AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md unified +
  `docs/STATUS.md` introduced.
- **PR #6** (merged) — feat(stats): aggregate real match stats from
  `replayData`. Replaced placeholder in `/api/me/stats` with real
  win/loss/turn/damage aggregation.
- **PR #5** (merged) — feat(simulator): turn-by-turn match simulation
  server-side. New `src/lib/match-simulator.ts`; `server.ts` emits
  `turn_event` / `match_result`; battle page consumes them for HP /
  position / direction / log.
- **PR #4** (merged) — ci: lint / type-check / build workflow.
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci`, `lint`, `tsc --noEmit`, and
  `next build` on every PR.
