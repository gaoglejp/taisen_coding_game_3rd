# Status

Rolling cross-agent status report shared between Claude Code and Codex.
Updated on every push. See `AGENTS.md` for the workflow expectations.

When you push, do these three things in `docs/STATUS.md`:

1. Move the current "Latest" block into "History" (one-line summary).
2. Replace "Latest" with the new PR's details.
3. Refresh "Next 1–3 PRs" and "Open questions" if anything changed.

## Latest

- **PR**: #55 — fix(nav): audit and harden screen transitions
- **Branch**: `codex/v0.2-nav-audit`
- **Date**: 2026-05-25
- **Status**: open, awaiting CI

### What changed

- Added `docs/NAV_AUDIT.md` with the `src/app` + `src/components` navigation
  matrix: 6 broken route/auth landings found, 6 fixed, 0 要判断. Dynamic
  parameters were checked for roomNumber / roomId / matchId consistency.
- Fixed known 404s: `/admin/system` now redirects to `/admin/system/rooms`;
  `/admin` is role-aware; `/admin/system/settings` and `/practice` are minimal
  準備中 pages using existing chrome.
- Fixed one additional dead route: dashboard recent-match replay links now use
  `/watch/[matchId]` instead of nonexistent `/replay/[id]`.
- Fixed the ROOM_ADMIN `/admin` landing auth path by allowing assigned room
  admins to GET `/api/admin/rooms/[id]` for overview display; PATCH/DELETE
  remain SYSTEM_ADMIN-only.
- Added `e2e/navigation.spec.ts`: dashboard→rooms→room→coding, practice,
  replay→watch, system-admin sidenav, `/admin` role redirects, and error-page
  admin buttons.
- Local verification: `db:push`, `db:seed`, `tsc`, `lint`, Vitest 146,
  `build`, and Playwright 10 all green. `lint` still has 4 pre-existing
  warnings.

### Next 1–3 PRs (recommended order)

1. **Playwright E2E Scope B** — two browser contexts for
   taro/hanako coding→lock→battle→result, plus watch viewer-count smoke.
2. **Manual test-play pass** by the spec owner using `docs/TESTPLAY.md`
   (the wired loop has never been run end-to-end in a browser).
3. **Decision-gated** backlog (only if product/schema calls are made):
   `InviteCode` model + signup validation, 2FA, email confirmation, coding
   `lastTurn` source, true tournament bracket linkage, obstacles/items.
   Plus the standalone `next-auth` dependency removal (no decision needed).

### Deferred / out of scope right now

- Commentary feed (watch) — placeholder, post-v0.2 (no backing system).
- Obstacles / items / AP in the simulator — post-v0.2 (only `maxTurns` wired).
- Coding `lastTurn` tab — needs a product call (one-shot simulation).
- True tournament bracket *tree* — needs `Match` advancement linkage (schema).
- `RoomActivity` model producers remain unused; activity is unified on
  `AuditLog` (per #37).

### Open questions / handoff notes

- Scope A browser smoke is automated and locally green. The full wired v0.2
  loop still needs **Scope B E2E** and the manual `docs/TESTPLAY.md` pass.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` remains a draft pending product confirmation.
- `npm run lint` carries 4 pre-existing warnings (unrelated to recent diffs).

## History

- **PR #53** (open at handoff) — fix(rooms): added the missing `/rooms` index
  so dashboard CTA/empty-state links no longer 404; flagged `/practice` for the
  nav audit follow-up. (Claude)
- **PR #52** (merged) — fix(proxy): keep `/watch` anonymous — removed it from
  the `proxy.ts` matcher (public spectating is `no-auth`); recorded proxy.ts +
  #51 auth fixes as HANDOFF decision #11. (Claude)
- **PR #51** (merged) — test(e2e): Playwright Scope-A smoke (4-role login +
  protected redirect + room page) + CI `e2e` job with `postgres:16`; the smoke
  surfaced & fixed 3 auth bugs (cookie `secure`-on-HTTPS, logout `prefetch`,
  login credentials) and added `src/proxy.ts` edge guard. (Codex)
- **PR #48** (merged) — test(match-api): route-handler tests for
  `/api/match/[matchId]/{public,state,result,replay}`; suite to 143 and
  handler-level API coverage complete. (Codex)
- **PR #46** (merged) — test(player): route-handler tests for player read
  APIs (`rooms/:n` + matches/standings, `me/stats` aggregation, `me/matches`);
  suite 112 → 128. (Codex)
- **PR #44** (merged) — feat(rooms): wired 「あなたの予定」 to real match data
  (`selectMySchedule`, interim definition: own active matches by
  `codingDeadlineAt`). Milestone C complete. (Codex)
- **PR #42** (merged) — feat(coding): wired the coding countdown to
  `codingDeadlineAt` (`secondsUntil` pure fn, 300s fallback). (Codex)
- **PR #40** (merged) — feat(simulator): room `rulePreset.maxTurns` now
  applies to live `simulate(...)` via `coding_lock` (+ normalization). (Codex)
- **PR #38** (merged) — test(admin): rooms write routes + activity feed route
  tests; suite to 100. (Claude)
- **PR #37** (merged) — feat(admin): room overview activity feed from the
  audit log (`GET /api/admin/rooms/:id/activity`); `MOCK_ACTIVITIES` removed. (Codex)
- **PR #36** (merged) — test(admin): member + account write-route tests
  (members issue/disable/reissue, users invite/force-reset); suite to 77. (Claude)
- **PR #34** (merged) — feat(watch): spectator real-data — Socket.io presence
  `viewer_count` + timeline from `turn_event`/replay; fabricated delta removed. (Codex)
- **PR #32** (merged) — test(admin): matches POST + users PATCH route tests;
  suite to 53. (Claude)
- **PR #31** (merged) — feat: room announcements (admin CRUD API + admin page
  + student rooms-page wiring; `Announcement` model). (Codex)
- **PR #30** (merged) — test(admin): first route-handler tests (match-cancel +
  standings) + a Vitest `@`→`src` alias; 37 tests. (Claude)
- **PR #29** (merged) — feat(admin): `TournamentView` as a round-grouped
  real-match list; true bracket tree still needs schema linkage. (Claude)
- **PR #27** (merged) — chore(watch): removed the dev-only state-variations
  gallery (+ 5 helpers). (Claude)
- **PR #26** (merged) — feat(admin): `RoundRobinView` head-to-head matrix +
  W/L/D summary from real match data. (Claude)
- **PR #25** (merged) — feat(admin): create-match modal → real member picker +
  per-mode `POST …/matches`; dropped the unbacked 備考 field. (Claude)
- **PR #24** (merged) — feat(admin): enriched `/api/admin/rooms/:id/standings`
  (avg dmg/turns/recent-form + summary) + wired the standings page. (Claude)
- **PR #23** (merged) — feat(coding): real Blockly (v12) editor +
  `strategy-blocks.ts` workspace→`Strategy` serializer. Milestone A unblocked. (Claude)
- **PR #22** (merged) — feat(admin): match-cancel endpoint + matches-page modal. (Claude)
- **PR #21** (merged) — feat(admin): system rooms + users page write actions
  (create/delete/archive·restore; invite/disable/reset via `LinkResult`). (Claude)
- **PR #20** (merged) — feat(admin): room member write actions
  (issue/reissue/disable); removed `MOCK_ISSUED_CODES`. (Claude)
- **PR #19** (merged) — feat(admin): room settings page → `/api/admin/rooms/:id`
  (GET/PATCH + archive/restore/delete), SYSTEM_ADMIN-only. (Claude)

- **PR #17** (merged) — feat(admin): room members page → real data + standings. (Claude)
- **PR #16** (merged) — feat(admin): system audit page + room overview page. (Claude)
- **PR #15** (merged) — feat(admin): system rooms page → `/api/admin/rooms`. (Claude)
- **PR #14** (merged) — feat(admin): system users page → `/api/admin/users`. (Claude)

- **PR #12** (merged) — feat(rooms): matches list + standings + your-record. (Claude)
- **PR #11** (merged) — feat(rooms): rooms page hero + added `docs/ROADMAP.md`. (Claude)
- **PR #10** (merged) — chore(test): Vitest + 9 simulator unit tests + CI. (Claude)
