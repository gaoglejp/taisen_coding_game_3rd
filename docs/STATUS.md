# Status

Rolling cross-agent status report shared between Claude Code and Codex.
Updated on every push. See `AGENTS.md` for the workflow expectations.

When you push, do these three things in `docs/STATUS.md`:

1. Move the current "Latest" block into "History" (one-line summary).
2. Replace "Latest" with the new PR's details.
3. Refresh "Next 1–3 PRs" and "Open questions" if anything changed.

## Latest

- **PR**: #20 — feat(admin): wire room member write actions (issue / reissue / disable)
- **Branch**: `claude/v0.2-implementation-handoff-ZapvB`
- **Date**: 2026-05-23
- **Status**: open, awaiting CI

### What changed

- **`src/app/admin/rooms/[roomId]/members/page.tsx` write actions wired**
  — first PR that performs real admin mutations:
  - **発行 (issue)**: parses the CSV textarea (`username,display_name`
    per line) and `POST`s `{ members, expiresAt }` to
    `/api/admin/rooms/:id/members`. The returned issue codes populate the
    one-time result modal (real codes, not mock), then the list reloads.
  - **再発行 (reissue)**: `POST
    /api/admin/rooms/:id/members/:mid/reissue`; shows the new code in the
    result modal and reloads.
  - **無効化 (disable)**: `PATCH /api/admin/rooms/:id/members/:mid` with
    `{ status: "DISABLED" }` (gated behind the username re-type confirm),
    then reloads.
  - Removed `MOCK_ISSUED_CODES`. Added `busy` (button spinners) and a
    per-modal `actionError`. The `reload()` fetch was extracted to a
    `useCallback` so mutations can refresh the table.
- All three endpoints already allowed `ROOM_ADMIN` (own room), so this
  works for both ROOM_ADMIN and SYSTEM_ADMIN with no API change.

### Next 1–3 PRs (recommended order)

1. **Remaining admin write actions** (ROADMAP Milestone D). Members are
   done; wire the rooms-page create-room modal (`POST /api/admin/rooms`)
   and the users-page invite/disable/reset modals
   (`POST /api/admin/users/invite`, `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id`,
   `POST .../force-password-reset`). **Match-cancel still needs a new
   endpoint** (`MATCH_CANCEL` audit action exists, route doesn't).
2. **Blockly → strategy JSON serializer** (ROADMAP Milestone A, the
   critical-path blocker). Needs a product call first: real Blockly
   integration vs. a lightweight rule-builder. Highest-leverage piece
   for actual gameplay once decided.
3. **Enriched standings endpoint + room standings page** (ROADMAP
   Milestone D). Add per-player avg-damage / avg-turns / recent-form
   (from `replayData`) to `/api/admin/rooms/:id/standings`, then wire the
   standings page that was deferred in PR #18.

### Deferred / out of scope right now

- Admin pages mock removal (same mechanical pattern, lower visibility).
- Real-time room ranking on the result page (needs an aggregation
  endpoint).
- Item / barrier / obstacle support in the simulator (extends
  `TurnSnapshot` additively per decision #9 in `docs/HANDOFF.md`).
- Watch page UI cleanup (drop state-gallery, replace placeholder
  commentary / viewer count). Flagged in #9's status block.
- Email confirmation on signup (HANDOFF section 4 item 4).

### Open questions / handoff notes

- **`docs/ROADMAP.md` is a draft pending product review.** Its
  milestones and "definition of done" are inferred from the prototypes
  + schema, not a written spec. Scope lines marked **(TBD)** need a
  product decision: whether obstacles/items/AP, live commentary, 2FA,
  and email confirmation are in v0.2 or post-v0.2. Resolve those before
  building the affected items.
- The rooms page's "あなたの予定" schedule and announcements still need
  backing data. Announcements would need a new endpoint over the
  existing `Announcement` model; the schedule needs a defined source
  (upcoming matches? coding deadlines?) — **TBD**.
- The simulator tests intentionally don't exercise an HP_ZERO win —
  no in-bounds starting alignments hit with the current six action
  types. Add coverage once AP / obstacles / items land.
- If Codex picks up work next: please update this file's "Latest" block
  when you push, even if the change is small. Keeping the rolling log
  current is what makes the cross-agent handoff usable.

## History

- **PR #19** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room settings page to
  `/api/admin/rooms/:id` (GET/PATCH + archive/restore/delete),
  SYSTEM_ADMIN-only per product decision. rulePreset round-trips but is
  simulator-inert.
- **PR #18** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room matches page (LIST) to
  `/api/admin/rooms/:id/matches`. Bracket views + create/cancel modals
  still mock; matches endpoint extended to return `room`.
- **PR #17** (merged) — feat(admin): wire room members page to
  `/api/admin/rooms/:id/members` (+ standings for W/L/D). Members
  endpoint extended to return `room`.
- **PR #16** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system audit page (cursor
  pagination; category/type filtered client-side) + room overview page
  (`/api/admin/rooms/:id` + matches/standings; activity still mock).
- **PR #15** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system rooms page to
  `/api/admin/rooms` (server-side filter + pagination + global status
  count pills). ROADMAP Milestone D rooms-page row done.
- **PR #14** (merged) — feat(admin): wire system users page to
  `/api/admin/users` (server-side filter + pagination). ROADMAP
  Milestone D users-page row done.
- **PR #13** (merged) — test(auth): 15 unit tests for `src/lib/auth.ts`
  (token round-trip, role guards, `getSession` branches with mocked
  cookies + Prisma). Suite total 24. ROADMAP Milestone E auth row done.
- **PR #12** (merged) — feat(rooms): wire matches list + standings +
  your-record to `/api/rooms/:n/{matches,standings}`. ROADMAP Milestone
  C mostly done (schedule + announcements remain).
- **PR #11** (merged) — feat(rooms): wire rooms page hero to
  `/api/rooms/:roomNumber` + add `docs/ROADMAP.md` (v0.2 definition of
  done + milestones A–E).
- **PR #10** (merged) — chore(test): Vitest + 9 simulator unit tests +
  wired into CI. HANDOFF section 4 item 5 closed.
- **PR #9** (merged) — feat(watch): wire watch page to
  `/api/match/:id/public` + live `turn_event`. Drops `META` constant;
  tank positions / HP / actions / cumulative damage all live.
- **PR #8** (merged) — feat(coding): wire coding page header to
  `/api/match/:id/state`. Drops `MOCK_MATCH` from the coding page;
  `/state` endpoint extended to include `room`.
- **PR #7** (merged) — feat(result): wire result page to
  `/api/match/:id/result` + AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md unified +
  `docs/STATUS.md` introduced.
- **PR #6** (merged) — feat(stats): aggregate real match stats from
  `replayData`. Replaced placeholder in `/api/me/stats` with real
  win/loss/turn/damage aggregation.
- **PR #5** (merged) — feat(simulator): turn-by-turn match simulation
  server-side. New `src/lib/match-simulator.ts`; `server.ts` emits
  `turn_event` / `match_result`; battle page consumes them for HP /
  position / direction / log.
- **PR #4** (merged) — ci: lint / type-check / build workflow.
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci`, `lint`, `tsc --noEmit`, and
  `next build` on every PR.
