## Latest

- **PR**: pending — test(e2e): strengthen anonymous watch regression
- **Branch**: `codex/v0.2-watch-anon-verify`
- **Date**: 2026-05-26
- **Status**: local verification green; ready to open PR

### What changed

- **Strengthened the Scope B watch regression** in
  `e2e/zz-scope-b.spec.ts`. The anonymous watcher now verifies more than a
  positive `viewer_count`: it waits for the live board turn counter and
  timeline cursor to move from `T0`, proving `turn_event` reaches a
  cookie-less `/watch/:matchId` socket.
- Added a second anonymous watcher context to verify `viewer_count` increments
  on join and decreases again after `context.close()`, covering the
  `join_match` + `disconnecting` broadcast path.
- Local verification:
  `npm ci`; `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`; `npm run db:push`;
  `npm run db:seed`; `npm run build`; `npx playwright test` green **3
  consecutive runs with `db:seed` before each run**. Also green:
  `npx tsc --noEmit`; `npm run lint` (0 errors, 4 pre-existing warnings);
  `npm test` (**146**); `npm run build`.
- Anonymous write-protection remains covered by server-side guard
  (`coding_lock` no-ops without `socket.data.userId`) and is not additionally
  asserted by this browser E2E.

### Next 1–3 PRs (recommended order)

1. **Manual test-play pass** by the spec owner using `docs/TESTPLAY.md`
   (the wired loop has never been run end-to-end in a browser).
2. **Decision-gated** backlog (only if product/schema calls are made):
   `InviteCode` model + signup validation, 2FA, email confirmation, coding
   `lastTurn` source, true tournament bracket linkage, obstacles/items.
   Plus the standalone `next-auth` dependency removal (no decision needed).

### Deferred / out of scope right now

- Commentary feed (watch) — placeholder, post-v0.2 (no backing system).
- Obstacles / items / AP in the simulator — post-v0.2 (only `maxTurns` wired).
- Coding `lastTurn` tab — needs a product call (one-shot simulation).
- True tournament bracket *tree* — needs `Match` advancement linkage (schema).
- `RoomActivity` model producers remain unused; activity is unified on
  `AuditLog` (per #37).

### Open questions / handoff notes

- Scope A/Nav/Scope B browser smoke is automated and locally green. The full
  wired v0.2 loop still needs the manual `docs/TESTPLAY.md` pass.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` remains a draft pending product confirmation.
- `npm run lint` carries 4 pre-existing warnings (unrelated to recent diffs).

## History

- **PR #60** (merged) — fix(watch): allow anonymous Socket.io spectating —
  relaxed `server.ts` `io.use` so cookie-less `/watch` sockets can receive
  read-only `turn_event` / `viewer_count`; write events still require
  `socket.data.userId`. (Claude)
- **PR #59** (merged) — test(e2e): Scope B realtime smoke — taro/hanako lock
  via two contexts → auto battle → result, plus a watcher `viewer_count`
  assertion; single-worker E2E + seed `codingDeadlineAt` reset. (Codex)
- **PR #57** (merged) — fix(nav): wired system-rooms "詳細" to
  `/admin/rooms/:id` and extended E2E to cover room-admin sidenav links. (Claude)
- **PR #56** (merged) — docs: amended the room-auth decision so it matches PR #55
  (`GET /api/admin/rooms/:id` allows own-room ROOM_ADMIN; writes stay sysadmin). (Claude)
- **PR #55** (merged) — fix(nav): navigation audit (`docs/NAV_AUDIT.md`, 6 broken
  → 6 fixed) — `/admin`, `/admin/system`, `/admin/system/settings`, `/practice`,
  dashboard replay→`/watch`; relaxed `GET rooms/:id` for own-room ROOM_ADMIN;
  added `e2e/navigation.spec.ts` + system-admin sidenav coverage. (Codex)
- **PR #53** (merged) — fix(rooms): added the missing `/rooms` index
  so dashboard CTA/empty-state links no longer 404; flagged `/practice` for the
  nav audit follow-up. (Claude)
- **PR #52** (merged) — fix(proxy): keep `/watch` anonymous — removed it from
  the `proxy.ts` matcher (public spectating is `no-auth`); recorded proxy.ts +
  #51 auth fixes as HANDOFF decision #11. (Claude)
- **PR #51** (merged) — test(e2e): Playwright Scope-A smoke (4-role login +
  protected redirect + room page) + CI `e2e` job with `postgres:16`; the smoke
  surfaced & fixed 3 auth bugs (cookie `secure`-on-HTTPS, logout `prefetch`,
  login credentials) and added `src/proxy.ts` edge guard. (Codex)
- **PR #48** (merged) — test(match-api): route-handler tests for
  `/api/match/[matchId]/{public,state,result,replay}`; suite to 143 and
  handler-level API coverage complete. (Codex)
- **PR #46** (merged) — test(player): route-handler tests for player read
  APIs (`rooms/:n` + matches/standings, `me/stats` aggregation, `me/matches`);
  suite 112 → 128. (Codex)
- **PR #44** (merged) — feat(rooms): wired 「あなたの予定」 to real match data
  (`selectMySchedule`, interim definition: own active matches by
  `codingDeadlineAt`). Milestone C complete. (Codex)
- **PR #42** (merged) — feat(coding): wired the coding countdown to
  `codingDeadlineAt` (`secondsUntil` pure fn, 300s fallback). (Codex)
- **PR #40** (merged) — feat(simulator): room `rulePreset.maxTurns` now
  applies to live `simulate(...)` via `coding_lock` (+ normalization). (Codex)
- **PR #38** (merged) — test(admin): rooms write routes + activity feed route
  tests; suite to 100. (Claude)
- **PR #37** (merged) — feat(admin): room overview activity feed from the
  audit log (`GET /api/admin/rooms/:id/activity`); `MOCK_ACTIVITIES` removed. (Codex)
- **PR #36** (merged) — test(admin): member + account write-route tests
  (members issue/disable/reissue, users invite/force-reset); suite to 77. (Claude)
- **PR #34** (merged) — feat(watch): spectator real-data — Socket.io presence
  `viewer_count` + timeline from `turn_event`/replay; fabricated delta removed. (Codex)
- **PR #32** (merged) — test(admin): matches POST + users PATCH route tests;
  suite to 53. (Claude)
- **PR #31** (merged) — feat: room announcements (admin CRUD API + admin page
  + student rooms-page wiring; `Announcement` model). (Codex)
- **PR #30** (merged) — test(admin): first route-handler tests (match-cancel +
  standings) + a Vitest `@`→`src` alias; 37 tests. (Claude)
- **PR #29** (merged) — feat(admin): `TournamentView` as a round-grouped
  real-match list; true bracket tree still needs schema linkage. (Claude)
- **PR #27** (merged) — chore(watch): removed the dev-only state-variations
  gallery (+ 5 helpers). (Claude)
- **PR #26** (merged) — feat(admin): `RoundRobinView` head-to-head matrix +
  W/L/D summary from real match data. (Claude)
- **PR #25** (merged) — feat(admin): create-match modal → real member picker +
  per-mode `POST …/matches`; dropped the unbacked 備考 field. (Claude)
- **PR #24** (merged) — feat(admin): enriched `/api/admin/rooms/:id/standings`
  (avg dmg/turns/recent-form + summary) + wired the standings page. (Claude)
- **PR #23** (merged) — feat(coding): real Blockly (v12) editor +
  `strategy-blocks.ts` workspace→`Strategy` serializer. Milestone A unblocked. (Claude)
- **PR #22** (merged) — feat(admin): match-cancel endpoint + matches-page modal. (Claude)
- **PR #21** (merged) — feat(admin): system rooms + users page write actions
  (create/delete/archive·restore; invite/disable/reset via `LinkResult`). (Claude)
- **PR #20** (merged) — feat(admin): room member write actions
  (issue/reissue/disable); removed `MOCK_ISSUED_CODES`. (Claude)
- **PR #19** (merged) — feat(admin): room settings page → `/api/admin/rooms/:id`
  (GET/PATCH + archive/restore/delete), SYSTEM_ADMIN-only. (Claude)
- **PR #18** (merged) — feat(admin): room matches page (LIST) → real data. (Claude)
- **PR #17** (merged) — feat(admin): room members page → real data + standings. (Claude)
- **PR #16** (merged) — feat(admin): system audit page + room overview page. (Claude)

- **PR #12** (merged) — feat(rooms): matches list + standings + your-record. (Claude)
- **PR #11** (merged) — feat(rooms): rooms page hero + added `docs/ROADMAP.md`. (Claude)
- **PR #10** (merged) — chore(test): Vitest + 9 simulator unit tests + CI. (Claude)
